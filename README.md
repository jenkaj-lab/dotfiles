# My dotfiles
I've tried different Operating Systems (OS), I've tried different distributions, and I've tried different Desktop Environments (DE). I never really felt like I had full control or how my computer looks and feels, and I think that's largely due to the fact that I'm a bit of a minimalist. But on top of that, I really enjoy customizing my experience. So because of that I've decided to make my own dotfiles and start with a minimal Arch Linux install. That is what inspired this repo, and that is what it is designed for.

Because I like a minimalistic feel, most of this setup is based around the terminal and hotkeys.
